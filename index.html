        There’s a core belief at the heart of adoption: Family is more than biology.
<br><br>
        <b>♥♡Family is love.♡♥</b>
        <br><br>
        Due to our belief in this absolute truth, we are proud to fully support LGBTQ adoption. We assist in many LGBTQ adoptions and have been honored to help hundreds of wonderful couples fulfill their dream of becoming parents.
        <br><br>
        Today’s families are more diverse than ever, especially in the world of adoption — transracial, multicultural, same-sex and single-parent families are all often created through adoption. Same-sex adoption statistics suggest that more and more gay couples are adopting. In fact, same-sex couples are four times more likely to be raising an adopted child and six times more likely to be raising foster children than heterosexual couples. Today, 4 percent of adopted children and 3 percent of foster children are raised by gay and lesbian parents, and 2 million more LGBTQ individuals are interested in adopting.

          <h2>LGBTQ+ Rights in Different Regions</h2><br>
            <p>Although LGBTQ+ people in every region of the world face marginalization and repression, their human rights have steadily advanced.Yet in many countries, LGBTQ+ individuals still face repression, imprisonment, and even the threat of death.Given the severity and ubiquity of such abuses, laws and safeguards protecting this community from legal discrimination and political, social, and economic marginalization have become a priority for activists and a growing number of governments.</p>

            <p>The issues that arise in lesbian- and gay-parented families are a function of two things: One is the rich variety of family constellations they comprise, and the other is the fact that they are living in a society which does not yet value rich variety. The tension created by this situation generates unique needs for millions of gay and lesbian parents in the world whenever they present themselves to the legal system, the educational system, the mental health profession, religious organizations, the medical profession, or the insurance industry - to name just a few.</p>
