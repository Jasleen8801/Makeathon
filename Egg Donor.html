  <h1>Should I use an egg donor?</h1><br>
  <p>
    To determine whether using an egg donor is the appropriate choice for you, you first need to make sure you know the actual cause of your infertility. That starts with getting a correct diagnosis.
  </p><br><br>
  <h1>Why might my fertility specialist recommend using an egg donor?</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    If you do not have eggs that will successfully fertilize and result in a healthy pregnancy due to various medical conditions or simply because of your age, your fertility specialist may recommend using an egg donor.<br><br>
    Egg donation is a viable infertility treatment for women with any of the following conditions:<br><br>
    •Diminished ovarian function due to ovarian cysts<br>
    •Cancer of the ovaries or other ovary disease<br>
    •Lacking ovaries<br>
    •Compromised egg or embryo quality<br>
    •Poor ovarian response to fertility medications<br>
    •Diagnosed or suspected of genetic disease<br>
    •Family history of genetic disease<br><br>
</p>

Egg donation has also been shown to be a successful treatment for women who have had multiple IVF (in vitro fertilization) cycles and failed to achieve a pregnancy.<br>

<h1>Egg Donor Instead of a Surrogate?</h1><br>
<p>
    For many women, the satisfaction of being able to carry a child to term is why they choose an egg donor instead of using a surrogate.
