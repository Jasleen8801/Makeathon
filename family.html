    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Whether you identify as same/similar gender-attracted and/or are transgender, if you want to have a baby or raise children, you have many options—possibly more options that you’ve imagined.
Granted, having babies as a same- or similar-gender couple or transgender individual can be complicated. There are logistical issues, legal hurdles, and financial obstacles that cisgender heterosexual couples rarely consider or ever need to deal with.
<br><br><br></p>
<h3>Fertility in LGBT Families</h3><br><br>
<p>
Just like heterosexual couples, some LGBT people will face infertility on top of "situational" infertility. Further, intersex individuals (some of whom identify with the LGBT community) may be infertile or have diminished fertility. Discrimination may also arise in your journey towards parenthood, though it should not prevent or stop you. 
All that said, lots of people in the LGBT community are raising kids. In 2019, almost 29% of people identifying themselves as LGBT reported raising children.<br><br>
1. In the United States, an estimated 3 million LGBT individuals have had a child, and an estimated 6 million children have an LGBT parent.<br>
2. Same-gender couples—when compared to heterosexual couples—are six times more likely to be raising foster children and four times more likely to be raising an adopted child. Data from the 2010 U.S. Census shows that 19% of same-gender households report raising children. This includes those raising biological, adopted, or foster children.<br>
3. At the most basic level, your options for having kids are either with the help of assisted reproductive technologies or through the adoption or foster care network. A gay or transgender person’s options for parenting are given below.
These avenues are open to you whether you are single or partnered. They are also, in most cases, open to you even if you’re HIV-positive, as there are fertility procedures that significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission to a child or gestational carrier. Lack of financial resources is the most likely barrier to some (but not all) of these paths to parenthood.
Because of the many legal intricacies and variations between states (and countries) when it comes to establishing parenthood for LGBT singles and couples, it’s advised that you consult with a lawyer who's familiar with local family and reproductive law as you consider your options.

The treatments include sperm donation, insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF) for same sex female (lesbian) couples and egg donation and gestational surrogacy for gay couples. At Nazar we believe that “everyone should experience the gift of parenthood.”
