    Thanks to advances in reproductive technology, there are now options for gay couples who wish to become parents and have a child that is biologically related.<br><br>
    Gay couples who want to have children will need an egg donor, who provides the eggs, as well as a surrogate, who will carry the pregnancy. The partner wishing to use his sperm will undergo a semen analysis to test motility, volume, concentration and morphology of the sperm.<br><br>
    The couple will select an egg donor with one of our reputable egg donor agencies. Family members can also be used, if medically appropriate. Once the couple has identified both a gestational carrier and the egg donor, one or both male partners will provide sperm samples to be used in the insemination of the donated eggs.<br><br>
    Our egg donor program meets the highest level of professional standards and discretion based on criteria set forth by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.<br><br>

    The Options: Gay Couples
  </h1><br>

  <p>
    Nazar offers gay couples two primary options:
    <br><br>
    <b>Traditional Surrogacy with Artificial Insemination (AI)</b><br><br>
    In this case the surrogate is artificially inseminated with the intended biological father’s sperm.<br><br>
    <b>IVF and Egg Donation and Gestational Surrogate</b><br><br>
    IVF (in vitro fertilization) is used to control the ovulatory process, removing eggs from the donor’s ovaries and letting sperm fertilize them in a fluid medium (in vitro). The resulting embryos are then transferred to the surrogate’s uterus with the intent to establish a successful pregnancy.<br><br>

    •IVF, using donor eggs and sperm from one or both partners, the embryo is implanted into a surrogate.<br>
    •IVF, using donor eggs and donor sperm, the embryo is implanted into a surrogate.<br>
    •Traditional Surrogacy—the egg from a surrogate is fertilized by a partner or donor sperm.<br>

    The Steps: Gay Couples
 </h1><br>
 <p>
    Gay couples planning to build a family through fertility treatments will meet with their physician to discuss the details of using an egg donor, who provides the eggs, as well as a gestational carrier (surrogate), who will carry the pregnancy. The eggs can be fertilized with the sperm of one or both partners.<br><br>
    Some clinics are able to combine the sperm of each partner with separate batches of the donors eggs. This could result in twins, each with the same biological mother, but separate dads. If only one child is born, a DNA test will be needed to determine which donor is the father. One of the partners’ female relatives (e.g. a sister) could serve as the egg donor; her eggs would then be fertilized by the sperm of the other partner. In this way, the child would be biologically related to both men.
